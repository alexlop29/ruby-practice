>
> Method names should begin with a lowercase letter.

# Modules

> Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants. 
>
> Modules define a namespace, a sandbox in which your methods and
> constants can play without having to worry about being 
> stepped on by other methods and constants.

# Variables

> Local variables are variables whose scope is limited to the area where they are declared. 
>
> If a local variable is declared inside a method or a loop, then its scope is limited to that method or loop.

> A global variable is a variable that is available for the entire application to use.
>
> It is denoted by a $ preceding the variable.
> 
> Using global variables is not a good idea. It can lead to developers overwritting each other. 

> Instance variables are available to a particular instance. 
>
> Use the @ sign to define a variable.

> Constants take values that do not change through the entire application. 
>
> Use all capital letters while naming your constant so that the application knows how to handle it.
>
> Constants in Ruby can be overridden; Outputs Warning

> Class variables are variables that are available to a particular class. 
> 
> The syntax for this variable is @@ .
