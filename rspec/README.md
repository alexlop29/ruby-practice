# Behavior-Driven Development

Rspec is a "behavior-driven development (BDD) test framework".

Additional Info on BDD: https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-rspec

# Writing Effective Tests
> A good test will provide at least one of these benefits:
> 
> - Design guidance: helping you distill all those fantastic 
> ideas in your head into running, maintainable code
>
> - Safety net: finding errors in your code before your customers do
>
> - Documentation: capturing the behavior of a working system to help its maintainers”

## Tests vs. Specs vs. Examples
> A test validates that a bit of code is working properly.
>
> A spec describes the desired behavior of a bit of code.
>
> An example shows how a particular API is intended to be used.”


# Rspec Structure

> Developers start with an outline and fill it in as they go.

> “The three methods—describe, it, and expect—are the core APIs of RSpec.”


## Rspec.describe
> The RSpec.describe block creates an example group. 
> 
> An example group defines what you’re testing—in this case.
