# Writing Effective Tests
> A good test will provide at least one of these benefits:
> 
> - Design guidance: helping you distill all those fantastic 
> ideas in your head into running, maintainable code
>
> - Safety net: finding errors in your code before your customers do
>
> - Documentation: capturing the behavior of a working system to help its maintainers”
